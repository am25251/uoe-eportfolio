### About Me
------
Welcome to my electronic portfolio! I am currently pursuing postgraduate studies in Cybersecurity at the University of Essex Online, with a specialized focus on the integration of Cybersecurity and Artificial Intelligence (AI). In this academic journey, I am exploring how to better protect the industry. I am also exploring how different, and emerging technologies can be leveraged to enhance security practices and protect assets. I am looking at how to tackle emerging cyber threats efficiently and cost-effectively in theory and in real world scenarios.

Today’s digital landscape is being revolutionized by many technologies that bring both benefits and risks. My goal is to bridge the gap between adopting evolving fields, addressing risk, and gaining a deep understanding of computer science, cybersecurity, risk management, AI, Computer programming, data analytics, and more, while securing the development of innovative solutions to safeguard critical digital infrastructures.

Throughout my ongoing studies, I have, and will gain, more comprehensive knowledge in areas such as risk management, network security, machine learning algorithms, artificial intelligence, and cybersecurity. This e-portfolio displays my academic progress, projects, and research endeavors, offering insight into my development as a cybersecurity expert. I am engaged in continuous learning and evolving through firsthand projects, industry collaborations, and further exploration of the intersection between these two exciting fields.

#### Through my part-time studies at the University, I am enriching and expanding my knowledge in the following fields:
* **Intro into Cybersecurity** - Cybersecurty, digital tech, programming and networking fundemenatls.
* **Launching into Computing** - fundamentals of computing - Python, OS, architecture, networking and data analytics.
* **Security and Risk Management** - Governance, laws, industry standards and Regulations, Threat modeling, Quantitative Risk Modelling, Business Continuity, Disaster Recovery
* **Network Security** - computer networks, network analysis, threat assessment and cryptography.
* **Advanced Object-Oriented Design and Programming** - secure coding practices within computer science, AI, cyber security and data science.
* **Cloud Operations and Management** - cloud computing tools for scripting, GUI design and data analysis hybrid cloud, edge and fog computing, as well as emerging trends in the industry.
* **Digital Forensics** - specialicse knowledge of legal and technical aspects of modern investigations, cloud storage and IoT devices.
* **Research Methods and Professional Practice** - Critical appraisal, legal, social, cultural, ethical, Practical foundation in research methods and practical research settings
* **MSc. Computing end Project**
