# Launching into Computing - Summary

<br>
<br>

## Description
Throughout this unit, I gained much knowledge in core computing disciplines, including Software Engineering, Data Science, Artificial Intelligence (AI), Cybersecurity, and Enterprise IT Management, I also learned how these areas integrate to solve complex business and societal challenges, while considering the ethical, legal, and professional implications.

## Feelings
I felt Initially, an excitement and apprehension as the breadth of topics covered seemed quite vast. While some areas, like Cybersecurity, were familiar to me, others, such as Artificial Intelligence and Data Science, were more challenging. However, as I progressed through the unit and applied various methodologies, I began to become more confident in my ability to understand and solve complex computing problems.

## Evaluation
During the unit, I met a solid balance of theory and practice. One of the highlights was learning about how different computing disciplines interact to tackle real-world problems, ethical, societal, and legal considerations, especially in areas like AI and data privacy, was challenging. Nevertheless, involving practical computing principles, such as; Agile, DevOps, and additional cybersecurity frameworks significantly enhanced my ability to design secure and efficient solutions.

## Analysis
This unit helped me recognize that technical skills alone are not enough in the computing field and comprehending the societal and ethical impacts of technology, especially in AI and data privacy, is crucial. The real-world application of Agile and DevOps methodologies gave me a deeper appreciation for their effectiveness in producing ethical and secure computing solutions. I also learned that legal implications in design is just as important as technical execution.

## Conclusion
The unit had broadened my understanding of computing role in driving digital transformation and solving societal issues, it was clear that computing is not only about technology, but also about creating responsible, inclusive solutions. Now I realize the importance of integrating ethical considerations into technology design and development.

## Action Plan
I plan to further explore areas like ethical AI, sustainable software engineering, and enterprise IT governance. I aim to focus on how emerging technologies can be used to foster responsible and inclusive digital transformation, contributing to both business success and societal well-being.

### Feedback (tutor)

<details>
Your reflective presentation shows a strong understanding of the complex ethical and security challenges associated with AI adoption. You have successfully structured your slides around key themes such as AI foundations, real-world applications, governance, and ethical concerns. The integration of references to real frameworks (like GDPR and the EU AI Act) and case studies (e.g., Estonia and healthcare hackathons) demonstrates critical engagement and depth. The use of citations throughout adds credibility, and the transcript aligns well with academic and professional expectations. The flow between slides was logical, and your conclusions showed mature reflection on balancing innovation with accountability. However, there are areas where further refinement would improve your work. For instance, while the content was well-researched, some parts of the transcript could be more concise or paraphrased to avoid repetition, particularly in slides 6 and 7. Also, though your sources are appropriate, ensure that all data points, especially claims made about leadership accountability and HITL (human-in-the-loop), are consistently backed with direct references. You might also consider strengthening the reflection by including more personal insights about how this research influenced your thinking or professional perspective.
