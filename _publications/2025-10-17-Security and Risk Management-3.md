<summary>Tutor Feedback - Assignment - Assignment Peer Review: Risk Identification</summary>
Dear student, 

Thank you for submitting your group work and for all your effort. Please see your group feedback and grade: 

i.Knowledge and understanding of the topic/ issues under consideration (25%): Excellent understanding of  risk in both stages, as well as mitigation advice.-25 

Ii. Application of knowledge and understanding (25%): Here we have somewhat of a weak part. Some examples-case studies would have helped your clients understand the risk and also assess themselves  and understand better your assessment (don’t forget that your clients are not always experts). Also some sources were quite old (again, please don’t forget when it comes to the tech area, you are expected to show very recent sources).-18 

Iii. Criticality (25%):  Here I would like to see the acknowledgement of limitations and gaps also to the mitigation plans suggested.- 15 

Iv. Structure and Presentation (as detailed in the assessment guidance) (25%): no problems at all here. Loved the diagrams and how you visualised certain parts for your audience to have better understanding. -25 

<br>
Grade: 95%
<br>
<br>
Strong points: Understanding 

Points for further development: Criticality, sources 

Please remember, you can communicate with me for any questions. 

Kind regards, 

Your tutor
